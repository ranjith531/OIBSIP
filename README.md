**Task-1**
**IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**
This Project is the application of machine learning with python programming.
It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. 
Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning.
Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -
1. Dicision tree classifier 
2. K nearest classifier
3. SVM
4. Logistic Regression 
5. metrics
6. train_test_split
We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset.
This is easy and understable for machine learning staters( Naive ).

**Task-2**
**Unemployment in india**
Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. 
we have seen sharp increase in the unemployment rate during covid-19. so I have analyzed the unemployment in india.

**Task-3**
**Sales Prediction**
Sales are predicted in this project.
